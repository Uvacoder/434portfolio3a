[Can](https://twitter.com/candenzer), [Julian](https://twitter.com/julianmeninger) and I grouped up and decided on the track _Lüge der Medien_ by the German rapper _LGoony_.

### Background

The whole movie was on a Sony α7S mounted on a DJI Ronin-M. I used Final Cut Pro X for the cut as well as for the grading.

_[01:35](https://youtu.be/PnhMXjSavpc?t=95) – The floating objects are made with Cinema 4D and a 360° camera_

For the CGI we used a 360° camera to capture an HDR image of each scene to match the lighting as closely as possible.
